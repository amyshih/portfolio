                            <h4>Problem Analysis</h4>
                            <p align="left">This thesis applied Grounded Theory to conduct qualitative research in the most influential e-commerce consumer group — travel agencies. Through interviews with managers of the top-5 travel agencies and representative clients in Taiwan, I analyzed and summarized the concept of <i>Power Shifting</i>. The expectation gap between customers' demand and existing online services of travel agencies may enhance customer’s negative emotion and in turn magnify the gap to cause the so-called <i>negative stimulus</i>. The negative stimulus urges customers to look for ways to neutralize the dissatisfaction from travel agencies. Moreover, if the agencies are not able to handle the situation timely, customers have to deal with the issues by themselves. After the emergent issue settles, the customers would evaluate the agencies’ services or compensation based on their experiences and thus adjusting their dissatisfaction to the agencies.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p aligh="left">According to literatures, there are three aspects of advices to meet both managers’ and customers’ demands: specialization, value co-creation and mass customization. In response to characteristics of live chat (Online supporting system), four principle guidelines and feasible service encounters are summarized. Based on Berry’s three aspects of <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1177%2F009207039502300402#page-1" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#0088A8;">relationship marketing</a>, Taiwanese travel agencies devote most of their resources to financial bonds, namely to retain customers by practicing pricing strategies. This thesis aim to improve models of customer service by upgrading to higher aspects, social bond and structural bond.</p>

                            <h4>Service Gap Solution</h4>
                            <p>When I checked the customer journey, I found there is an obvious service gap on customer journey map, in which this thesis aims to improve this gap by Live chat services. So far, travel agencies only are informed with issues if customers file complaints; however, they are overlooking those unfiled messages. live chat services actually can be introduced when customers initiate motivation on travelling and guide them to choose products that best fit their requirements. In this case, live chat is able to record every detail, demands and hesitation, of the customer in the beginning for future advancement.</p>

                            <h4>Live Chat Service Improvement : Mobility</h4>
                            <p>During the interviews, almost every manager mentioned plans of introducing mobile devices to their services in the near future. This thesis proposes a concept of online mobility customer service, which aims to provide instant assistance for customers throughout the journey. </p>
                            <br>
                            <h4><strong> Before the trip </strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                The prototype of the new mobile online live chat system helps customers locate the nearest travel agent via Location-Based Service (LBS) or even reach out to customer service via voice calls or text messages on mobile phones. This service focuses on the gap from customers have incentive of traveling to the moment they contact to the travel agency spontaneously. From passive to active, this function aims to encourage travel agencies reach customers ss not only from passive-marketing ads, but also provide useful informations to customers. </p>

To advance the quality of services, agencies now can retrieve photos from mobile devices to send regards to their customers and meanwhile to get direct customer feedbacks.</p>

                        <h4>Design Concept</h4>
                        <p align="left">Located at Circum-Pacific Seismic Zone, Taiwanese encounter earthquakes frequently. The related disasters such as tsunami, fire and power outage always make people be injured. After the horrible 921 Earthquake, the 7.6 Mw earthquakes, aided more than 100,000 lost their home and got injured, Taiwanese government decided to teach the disaster prevention strategies in K-12 education. However, although children know the importance of the disaster protections, the existing teaching materials and methods could not stimulate them. Our team aimed to use design-thinking mindset to rethink the teaching methods and scenerios. We aim to develop solutions for children to learn the practical knowledge with willingness instead of antipathy. </p>

                            <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="left">| Design Thinking + Gamification</p>
                            <p>The project conducted user researches by using design thinking method. After interviewed students in elementary school and their teachers. We went through four workshops for finding insights to the final design.</p>

                            <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="left">| Empathize</p>
                            <p>After we defined the goal of the project, we used affinity diagram to gather and organize large amounts of data by evidencing their natural correlations. The post-it became physical instruments to find correlations and identify the significant groups. And we also listed out the experience journey of children from they started the class of earthquake prevention, including what they were thinking, feeling and doing. Also we listed the stakeholders' actions during this process.</p>

                                We designed a board game,<i> Concrete Jungle</i>, based on local geography to engage children with learning through game. 
                                We aim to enhance children’s preparation of disaster prevention. We hope teachers and parents can join in this game. Children as a player need to group up with other children as a team and beat disasters. By playing as several disasters that children will encounter after earthquakes happened, teachers and parents can give hints and directions during children discuss their strategy to run to safe places.

                            <p align="left">After we finished the prototype of <em>Concrete Jungle</em>, we conducted usability testing to have further feedback from real potential users. We gave the game to a family include a pair of parents, a 9-year-old boy, and a 7-year-old girl. We did not teach them the rule at first. They took over 30 minutes to understand the rule. We found many crucial points that we still need to improve from only communicating with users through the paper of rules.After we taught them the rule, the family really enjoyed the game. We observed that when the children just see the customized map, they can recognize the places near their school. Also, the children can actually connect the strategy in the game to real-world disaster situation.</p>

                                    <li>The rule should be easier to understand for K-12 students, it can also add Pin-Yin to  
                                     facilitate them to understand.</li>
                                     <li>The disaster-affected scope can be printed on the chess directly. In this case, players do 
                                         not need to check the rule cards repeatedly.</li>
                                         <li>Parents are children’s partners in the game, they could join the game in other way. For 
                                            example, parents could not only be the disasters to control the affected scope, they can also play as children's partners to discuss with their small partners and stimulate children's learning incentive more.</li>

                                        <h4>Design Concept</h4>
                                        <p align="left">Over the years, as we have grown to be increasingly dependent on technology, the importance of interactive design raises. When Smart TV has been emerging, online add-on services are featured on top of traditional functions of TV programs. However, the design of Smart TV remote controller is too complicated for users to handle compared with conventional ones. This project aim to provide the intuitive way of controlling our entertainment product, TV, with integration of motion sensing technology and Smart TV to enable straightforward controls by simple hand signals. Moreover, services of social networking and personalized recommendation are consolidated to redefine physical limitations and elevate user experiences in intelligent life.</p>

                                        <h4>KEY FACTOR</h4>
                                        <p align="left">This system furnishes with Microsoft Kinect motion sensors to detect users’ signals and control Windows system-simulated Smart TV. It replaces traditional controllers with users’ intuition hand signals, which also avoids problems in complicated operations or finding the controllers.</p>

In addition, we can also play with our friends when we are watching TV, even we are not watching TV at the same place. The avatar interaction function will show below the television and follow users' body motions. We can also clap for the nice catch in the ball game, or we can throw pie to the bad women in the soap opera. DON' TV aims to break the barrier of spaces and make people well connected.</p>

                                        The platform can be generalized in three areas: Persona, Trend and Technology. The user may conduct information collection and brainstorming activity on DIG platform. The system also analyzes highly relative consumer demands and technology trends in different fields based on the characteristics of the user’s project.</p>
                                        <br>

                                        <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="left">| Scenario study - Story from the Material and Chemical Research Laboratory in ITRI </p>
                                        <p>The Material and Chemical Research Laboratory of ITRI has long proposed an advanced technology of manufacturing hollow fiber membranes. However, the technical staffs have been in the related field for many years and were facing innovation difficulties. Through the DIG platform the research staff were able to set a initial potential user and also the core technology they had. After setting, the creative board would recommand related trending and application information that enable the research team to brainstorm and provide alternative insights for the possibility of innovative products.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>On the other hand, a dehumidifier company was in distress of being uncertain on their new product design plan. Based on the targeted consumer and market demand that the company’s project manager has input in the DIG platform, the system was able to analyze the key word “hollow fiber” and depict the technology’s applications and trends through user-friendly descriptions. Due to the online expert are available, the dehumidifier company talked to the expert and found they can collaborate with the Material and Chemical Research Laboratory of ITRI by using the hollow fiber technique to update the quality of their dehumidifier. As the result, the company found a surprising innovation for their product design on DIG. And the Material and Chemical Research Lab also step out of their original research boundary and open up another research direction.<p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>The platform greatly reduced the technical barrier for the company’s project manager to come up with a brainstorming idea that’s related to an advanced technology that the manager might have been unfamiliar with. On the other hand, DIG can also help researcher's results be eaily understood by outsiders. And further have more innovative developments.</p>

                                        <h4>Design Concept</h4>
                                        <p align="left">Technological developments affect CO2 emission, recovery and reuse in food, beverages and industries, which are superseding each other very rapidly nowadays. However, requirements regarding efficiency of the CO2 capture are becoming more stringent, as are the global warming issue. The proposed adsorption based high surface area fiber recovery unit is novel. Since gas mixture discharged to the atmosphere may contain a high proportion of CO2, a prototype will in all likelihood be tested in a field trial prior to a full scale prototype being designed in the bus. We aim to absorb CO2 as well as providing convinent life for our citizens. Our goal is to balance environment protections and econonmy developments.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h4>How it works to reducing the CO2 in the city air</h4>
                                        <p align="left">The Adsorbent Hollow Fiber System is installed on the roof of buses. When the breathing bus drives through the city, CO2 is adsorbed into the adsorbent hollow fiber and therefore provides the city with cleaner air. It can also remove CO2 from inside of the bus to provide passengers a more pleasant ride.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="left">|&nbsp;&nbsp;Concept Prototype</p>
                                        <img src="img/portfolio/citylung/prototype.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                                        <br>
                                        <p align="left">After the adsorption process or off-duty bus returns to its central station for recovery the high concentration of CO2 (>95%) from the adsorbent hollow fiber system by thermal-vacuum swing process. The recovered CO2 can be reused in the field of food, beverage and industries applications. This novel fiber technology will reduce the emission of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and solve one of the key issue of globe warming.</p>

                                        <h4>Challenge</h4>
                                        <p align="left">Although this idea we promoted aiming to protect our environment and create better quality of life, it did not raise any bus producers’ interest. Due to the high cost of updating a new ceiling with hollow fiber on the bus and lack of motivation, bus producers tended to maintain the status quo. So this project is still only in prototype stage, we are still trying to approach more bus companies and governmental institutions to apply this design.</p>

                                        <p align="left">Global warming is a big challenge for human beings whether some of us brace it or others repel it due to the inevitable inconveniences no matter how insignificant, it’s a matter of time that we will have to adapt these active, mass-scale CO2 sequestration. Each of us as a member of the mass public can participate in the gross effort of CO2 sequestration while enjoying better air quality. It will be perfectly acceptable whether some of us consider we are enjoying good air and collaterally contributing in CO2 sequestration or some others consider it’s the other way round.</p>

                                        <h4>About the hollow fiber based systems</h4>

                                        <p align="left">The proposal targets the potential development of a super sponge-like adsorbent fibers with the greenhouse gases removal and recycling systems. Adsorbent hollow fiber is like a black hole that can soak up greenhouse elements in the air.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p align="left">The elements it absorbs in could be controlled manually; the system consisting of filters and fibers os based on the use of uniquely adsorbent low pressure drop device. It is based on polymeric/inorganic materials hybrid technique and to develop a highly efficient, energy saving adsorption unit. It is expected that efficiency and energy saving by the new adsorption system will be up to half that of current technology.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p align="left">The system consumes less than 20% of the energy demand of a conventional thermal oxidation processes, which can be applied to the removal and recovery of many types of gases (CO2 and Volatile hydrocarbons (VOCs), etc.) and is applicable to a wide range of demanding processes/industries. This system promises significant reductions in environmental emissions, and cost effective recovery and reuse of the valuable solvents and gases.</p>

                                        <h4>Advantage</h4>
                                        <br>
                                        <h5 align="left"><span style="font-weight:bold;">・High efficiency</span></h5>
                                        <p align="left">Hollow fibers have high surface area/volume ratio (> 4000 m2/m3) that offer significant improvements in the efficiency of CO2 adsorption/recovery (e.g. the area/volume ratio of state of the art honeycomb multi-channel monoliths is 800 –1000 m2/m3). Another advantage of the fiber adsorption units is that it can be operated on an adsorption/regeneration cycle of 0.5 - 1 h, which allows for a considerable reduction in the adsorbent bed size and it is easily regenerate with low vacuum or thermal swing.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h5 align="left"><span style="font-weight:bold;">・Low cost manufacturing methods</span></h5>
                                        <p align="left">Many meters of fiber can be spun at any one time, and thus provision of fiber based modules will be price-competitive with existing technologies.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h5 align="left"><span style="font-weight:bold;">・Lightweight and compact</span></h5>
                                        <p align="left">Enabling flexible configurations of systems to be developed suitable for space-constrained or mobile applications. Our experiments to date have shown that the adsorption performance of the multi-layer hollow fiber module is better than that of an equivalent packed bed of zeolite/carbon adsorbents with around 1/100th of the pressure drop - this allows the adsorption units to be installed in ductwork/limited space without additional gas compression.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h5 align="left"><span style="font-weight:bold;">・Robust</span></h5>
                                        <p align="left">Use of multi layers means that fibers are handleable and not liable to fracture. As fibers are typically bundled together, any defects occurring during operation should have little or no consequence to the overall efficiency of the system.</p>

                            <h4>Challenge</h4>
                            <p align="left">In Taiwan, 30% of people with developmental delay come from low income families.
                                Several researches has discovered that due to the immense amount of time and effort to take care of their children, most of parents of the developmental delayed people find it difficult to maintain a full time job, thus these families are often having heavier financial burden.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Increase Social Participation&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong> Disabilitied people usually do not have many chances to interact with people in public places. It is especially crucial for developmentally delayed people to interact with more people, because they need to keep learning how to talk to avoid their brain functions deteriorate. But now developmentally delayed people in Ai-Heng trainning center usually stay in the trainning center and learn to make coffee and sell products. We aim to increase their social participation in this project.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Limited job opportunity&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong>People who are disabled are often facing lesser job opportunity. Although the level of disability for each individuals may vary, most of them are found with limited job opportunity.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Caring consumptions are hard to maintain&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong>The consumer behavior of buying products to support disabled individuals are often based on the idea of charity, in which the profit stability is hard to maintain, thus limiting the financial support toward the families with developmentally delayed children.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>

                        <h4>Project goal</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of this project aims to help families with developmental delayed adults to establish family business based on mobile coffee stands, and to raise more social awareness for developmental delayed adults and increasing their social participations.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Observation and In-depth Interview</h4>
                        <p>During the project, I led teammembers in ITRI observed the behaviors of the developmentally delayed people and also kept recording the working environment of the factory for later research. In addition, we interviewed the counselor in the trainning center about their experiences and the challenges they’ve encountered when interact with disability people and their families.</p>

                        <p>We observed that these disabilitied people can actually make coffee with congruence quality. Our team decided to define "coffee making with family" as our core to develop. And we also went to observed the real condition of the disabilitied people made coffee and record every detail down. In addition, we also researched some exiting mobile coffee stands in Taiwan to understand the operation methods and explore the possibility to use this idea for further design process.</p>

The mobile coffee stand project serves a great venturing model of creating job opportunities for the developmentally delayed families and provided firm prospect for related future works on helping the disabled individuals in different corners of the societies.In the future, we hope to optomize the interaction design between customers and developmentally delayed clerks. We will do more usibility testing after the finished products operate on the street. By producing more friendly interactions, we believe the small business will be sustainable and change the life of the developmentally delayed family.</p>
